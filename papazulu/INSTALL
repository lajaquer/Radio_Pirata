Just copy the "papazulu" perl file to where you want and the "sound" 
directory where you will remember where it is - the default is /usr/share/papazulu/sounds.

Probably the best way to install is to copy the whole papazulu directory to /usr/share/ and 
link the perl file to /usr/bin/papazulu

The program will of course work even if installed somewhere else.
